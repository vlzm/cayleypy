          quarter-turns allowed. There are 6 generators (front, right, down face - clockwise and counterclockwise).
      * "cube_2/2/2_9gensHTM" - same as above, but allowing half-turns (it has 9 generators).
      * "cube_3/3/3_12gensQTM" - Schreier coset graph for 3x3x3 Rubik's cube with fixed central pieces and only
          quarter-turns allowed. There are 12 generators (clockwise and counterclockwise rotation for each face).
      * "cube_3/3/3_18gensHTM" - same as above, but allowing half-turns (it has 18 generators).
      * "mini_pyramorphix" – Cayley graph for a subgroup of S_24, acting on 24 titles. It is generated by 17 moves
          inspired by a simplified version of the Pyramorphix puzzle. Moves are based on overlapping 2- and 3-cycles
          and result in a symmetric, undirected graph. (order of the graph 24, degree 17, order of the group 288)
      * "pyraminx" - Cayley graph for a subgroup pf S_36 acting on 36 tiles. It is generated by 8 elements inspired
          by Pyraminx puzzle. 4 elemets represent rotations  of the tetrahedron tips, while 4 others -- rotations
          of its base layers.
      * "hungarian_rings" - Cayley graph for S_n (n>=4), generated by rotating two rings in both directions.
          For each ring structure and their intersection it has four generators.
      * "starminx" - Cayley graph, generated by 20 moves of Starminx puzzle. Each move is a rotation of a
          corner, centered around one of the dodecahedron’s pentagonal faces (face centres never move). A single turn
          corresponds to a set of disjoint 3-cycles, each on one triangular sticker.
