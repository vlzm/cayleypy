        The following modes of random walk generation are supported:

          * "classic" - random walk is a path in this graph starting from `start_state`, where on each step the next
            edge is chosen randomly with equal probability. We generate `width` such random walks independently.
            The output will have exactly ``width*length`` states.
            i-th random walk can be extracted as: ``[x[i+j*width] for j in range(length)]``.
            ``y[i]`` is equal to number of random steps it took to get to state ``x[i]``.
            Note that in this mode a lot of states will have overestimated distance (meaning ``y[i]`` may be larger than
            the length of the shortest path from ``x[i]`` to `start_state`).
            The same state may appear multiple times with different distance in ``y``.
          * "bfs" - we perform Breadth First Search starting from ``start_state`` with one modification: if size of
            next layer is larger than ``width``, only ``width`` states (chosen randomly) will be kept.
            We also remove states from current layer if they appeared on some previous layer (so this also can be
            called "non-backtracking random walk").
            All states in the output are unique. ``y`` still can be overestimated, but it will be closer to the true
            distance than in "classic" mode. Size of output is ``<= width*length``.
            If ``width`` and ``length`` are large enough (``width`` at least as large as largest BFS layer, and
            ``length >= diameter``), this will return all states and true distances to the start state.
